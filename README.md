ImageRotator
============

This a simple web application that loads a random image on load of the default page. The image is retrieved from a data provider. This example was built to use in teaching an introduction to object-oriented programming class, and uses the Flickr API to pull images tagged with the word, "flower." It has no license and is free to use and extend.
