ImageRotator
============

This a simple ASP.NET C# web application that loads a random image on load of the default page. It uses a data provider (the Flickr API) to pull images tagged with the word, "flower." It has no license and is free to use and extend.

This small application was built to use in teaching an introduction to object-oriented programming class, and it demonstrates many basic concepts such as classes, properties, methods, ASP.NET web forms and life cycle page events, scope, interfaces, etc.
